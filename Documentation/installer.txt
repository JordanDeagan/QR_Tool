### INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ###

After installation of this program via the installer, if the program does not run, go to the program folder for this software (the location
where all of the software files are saved, which you choose or approved of in the next step) and find the 'Setup' folder. In that folder,
there are two files, 'vcredist_x64.exe' and 'vcredist_x86.exe', choose the proper one for your system and run that (in order to determine which
file to choose, go to your Windows Start Menu and search for 'System Information', and then locate the 'System Info' line. If the value for
that line has an 'x64' in it, then you should run 'vcredist_x64.exe', and if it has 'x32' or 'x86' in it, then run 'vcredist_x86.exe').


### POST INSTALLATION - SharePoint Online Service ###

After installation, in order to use the SharePoint Online Service, you must follow the steps found in the User Guide, which is located in the
'Documentation' folder on your C Drive (or wherever you installed the program).
